## IT Support System SQL Project

This project was developed as an exercise in modeling and SQL queries, focusing on fundamental practices for those training as Data Analysts.
The goal is to simulate a technical support system, with users, customers, technicians, tickets, and messages.

---

## Objective

Design a **relational database** capable of handling support requests, tracking progress, and associating each ticket with its respective client and technician.
The main goal is to demonstrate an understanding of **data modeling**, **relational structure**, and **query development** for analysis and reporting.

---

## Database Structure

**Main Entities:**

* **Users** – general user registry (clients or technicians)
* **Clients** – organizations that open tickets, linked to a user
* **Technicians** – employees responsible for solving tickets
* **Tickets** – records of support requests, including category, status, and timestamps
* **Messages** – communication logs between users about each ticket

The structure ensures **referential integrity** through foreign keys and cascading rules (`ON DELETE CASCADE`, `ON UPDATE CASCADE`).
